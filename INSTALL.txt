Installing the cmnfingerprinter
-------------------------------

The fingerprinter is a component written in C++. I used eclipse to build it.
This application is needed by the indexer, therefore it is important that you
make sure that the fingerprinter can be found.
You may for example create a link in the /usr/local/bin directory


Installing the Swing GUI
------------------------

The swing GUI was designed with Netbeans.


Everything else
---------------

It's python, simply run it!
