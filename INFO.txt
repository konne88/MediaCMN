Picard is a good tagger, but it's abilities to find duplicate files and create a music library without human interaction are not the best.
Therefore I wrote a little application for UNIX like systems, released under the GPL that makes it very easy to organizer all of your music files.

It first indexes all of your music files, read tags from the metadata and creates some hashes like music fingerprints.
The next step is to remove duplicate audio-files from the index by comparing the puids and fingerprints of the files.
It then tags them similar to picard but without human interaction by looking up the puids on musicbrainz.
Finally the files can be stored in a directory-structure like /artist/album/track.mp3
